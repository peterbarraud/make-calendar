# A super easy to use Calendar maker
Makes a simple HTMl file calendar that you can print to a PDF file (or maybe directly to a printer)

Steps:
1. Run the `main.py`
2. Choose the month for which you want the calendar

The output month.html file is created.


I chose to make a specific file name. Just so we don't end up making a whole bunch of files for different months.
